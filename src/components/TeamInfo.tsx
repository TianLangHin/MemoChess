        Our common interest in chess inspired us to create a tool that could utilise
        modern technology to make the lives of all chess players easier.
        With our computer vision solution, we hope to solve the problem of
        traditionally difficult record-keeping of chess games,
        which has relied on writing, memorising, or expensive DGT boards.

        With functionality such as a downloadable PGN,
        move validation, and customisable player names,
        our goal is to make the lives of players, arbiters and tournament organisers
        as easy as possible in record-keeping, which is crucial to the culture of chess.
